# Advent of Code 2022

This package is a tool for solving challenges from [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Swift. It can be used in two ways:

## Fork and start to code

With the `quickstart` branch you have a starting point to code right away without worrying about setting up a nice user interface. You can then use your version of this package to plug [into this app](https://github.com/bennokress/Advent-of-Code-2022-App) as long as you keep the same structure (everything in the Supporting Files folder).
